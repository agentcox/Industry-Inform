Woah.

You&apos;re dead. You have to be.

Fifty-one hours and an eyeblink ago you stood in front of a crowd of fifty-thousand outside the Gas Temple and made it clear that nobody was going to break you, your company, your shareholders, or the spirit of a people.

A minute later, you were assassinated.

At least, that&apos;s how it was supposed to go. You&apos;re supposed to be dead. Buried under a mountain of gray California dirt. So why does it feel like you&apos;re still alive?

An Interactive Fiction by Charles Cox

Forty-Fourth Floor Staircase
You are against the wall of a concrete staircase, cold and pourous. Through red emergency lighting, you can see a large stenciled number on the wall, indicating the forty-fourth floor. Somewhere, drifting in the echo of the concrete, you can hear the muffled sounds of fireworks, celebrating Armistice Day.

The stairs that lead up terminate at a concrete support, in which an entryway is just barely visible. Downward, the staircase leads into a dark black fog.

A handrail twists down the near edge of the staircase.

There is a fire locker on the wall.

But, the job has been done - you notice that the handrail has split and left a long slat within reach.

Forty-Fifth Floor Breezeway
As you crash the fire door at the top of the stairs, you are hit by an autumn squall - you&apos;ve made it out of the building onto a breezeway, and the wind up here is at storm velocity. The breezeway is a high modern arch, cresting over a series of transmission spikes glowing a dull red against the driving rain. It extends north toward a small observation annex.

Through the dark gray trunks of concrete on the breezeway, you can see far-flung fireworks exploding in the distance over the city.

A door leads back down to the staircase landing on the forty-fourth floor.

 A service gate marked by a sign is to the east and looks to lead underneath the breezeway structure.

Observation Annex
The observation annex of the Bastille Building is a mollusk-like protrusion off the north end of the building, comprising a large, coif-like curved wind scoop and an offset crescentform ledge where you stand now, looking out over the city, sheltered from the wind and rain by a glass shield.

You can see your reflection in a small but polished plaque that is mounted on the observation shield. Something is odd about your reflection.

Your right eye is gone. It is completely gone. Not even a trickle of blood traces back to the hole.

You stumble, faint and dead-sick at the sight. They&apos;ve taken your eye - someone carved it out of your head. As your remaining eye focuses on the plaque:

BASTILLE BUILDING CA. 2121
&quot;PLANT, AND REAP THE BOUNTY OF EARTH&quot;
COMMITTED TO US THIS ARMISTICE DAY BY:

You realize that your name is inscribed below.

This was your building, those many years ago.

So many years ago.

You fall to the concrete in pain and shock.

Somewhere out there, you can hear more fireworks exploding against the cityscape as the world fades, being sucked down through the hole where your eye used to be, draining into your brain...

Departure Lounge
People surround you; hurried, frayed, fast. Glass and steel beamwork cross in sweeping orbits around a large curved window that looks out over a greenbelted cityscape. The smell of hastily-fried foods mixed with heavy coffees. Black leather chairs embossed with friendly ORBGROUP logos line the main thoroughfare; white tile floors cut by vanishing-point aluminum slices extend on to the west and east until they curve out of sight. To your south is Gate Six.

There is a suited man here, busy on his phone.

The East lounge terminates in a spheroid droplet sculpture molded into the flesh of the building, casting a warped and eerie light from a bright, early morning onto the tile below your feet. The travelers that wait here seem anxious, strained for something, wearing unfocused expressions and slack ties. The rest of the lounge is back to your west. To your south is Gate Seven. A security monitor station is to the north.

A departure board hangs from the ceiling.

It is his signature that completes the following letter:


My Friend - 


Rare in my experience is a man who faces a set of circumstances such as you face now.


If you don&apos;t yet understand, you can trust me at least to help you see more clearly; LogoS is nothing if not the first to know in matters relational, and you can be assured: we know who mutilated you, who is to be blamed for your near-death in the City of Industry.


Understand, though: information cuts both ways, and we know the ruse you were playing as part of your Gas Temple campaign. Your deception was interrupted, and while not entirely exposed, your intentions were made clear to a few. We therefore know something about you, as well as your assailants.


To be sure, this would indicate two markers of advantage to us and none to you, but as I hinted earlier, your circumstances are exceptional. There is a service you can do for us, and to that end, you have received both an expedient exfiltration from the City, far enough away to hide our tracks, and as much medical care as we could administer enroute, so that you may be well enough to join us at our corporate center in Alexandria.


You have the necessary ticket for a suborbital flight on your person and my very best wishes for a safe and expedient trip up and over. Certainly, if you choose not to hear us out, we can&apos;t be blamed for any leakages of your personal affront to your own shareholders, let alone the law. Acher and The Priests may be old and slow, but a disgruntled market will shoulder them along to your door without much delay.


I add only that though our efforts have been both expedient and clandestine, there will be others with much at stake asking your whereabouts, and who may be in your midst now despite our precautions. If you are to act, be swift. You are by no means out of danger yet.


I remain yours very truly,


Jonathan French
President, LogoS Board of Directors

Departure Lounge
There is a suited man here, busy on his phone.

A low rumbling from somewhere outside draws your attention to the south windows of the departure lounge. You watch through the glass, and through and a haze of precautionary fire retardant glowing red from emergency lighting.

 A large mesh hoop is being drawn up to a forty-five degree angle out on the tarmac.

 The rumble grows, expands, splitting the air, layer after layer of fracturing, crackling screams. You see some of the travelers opening their mouths, stuffing their earphones deeper in their ears.

 The windows flex, pulse, vibrate. The sound grows unbearably loud - in an instant, there is a final whipcrack and the hoop is flexed to bursting, cradling a steaming, charred dart the size of a school bus.

 A voice comes over the lounge intercom: &quot;Whitmore Executive announces the arrival of flight 2A2, with service to Alexandria, Virginia, United States. This flight is now boarding at Gate Six.

Gate 6
Gate Six is empty in comparison to the other two gates. Either a flight just departed from this gate or nobody is interested in the next flight. The window has a view of the tarmac, where you can see ground crews scurrying about, readying for an arrival or a departure. Gate Five is to the west, Gate Seven to the east, and the departure lounge is to the north. The jetdoor blocks access to a jet bridge to the south.

Gate 7
This gate, lit in wide, langorous strips by the refracted sunlight through the droplet carved into the East lounge, is filled with haggard business travelers, many of whom have resigned themselves to a long wait, as evidenced by rolled-up sleeves, loosened ties, and half-full cups of coffee stacked within emptied cups, a stack for each traveler. The ORBGROUP ticketing station is unmanned, and the gate&apos;s jetdoor indicator glows a solid, lazy red. The departure lounge is back to the north. Gate Six is to the west.

 &quot;I - &quot; you manage, your hand edging up toward your face in embarassed reflex.

 &quot;We&apos;re required to tell you, Sir,&quot; the agent continues, &quot;that prosthetic eyes are not allowed on any ORBGROUP flight. They have the habit of becoming projectiles when the entry vehicle decelerates.&quot;

 You hesitate, unsure what to say next.

 The agent has already calmly printed out a boarding pass and handed it to you. &quot;ORBGROUP policy - if you would head to the restrooms and remove the prosthetic before flight. Sir.&quot;

 &quot;You want me to take my own eye out?&quot; you ask.

 &quot;The restrooms are in the food court, just north of Departure Lounge West, Sir. And if you could hurry, Sir. We&apos;re fueled and ready to clear the gate.&quot; The agent returns to the scanner, leaving you with the pass.

The attendant shows you to your harness module and makes the usual motions to instruct you on emergency release procedures in the case of zero-atmosphere depressurization, gimbal lock, and solar flares.
At last, she drops the latest Zink in your lap and smiles, checking that your harness is buckled and that you&apos;re ready to head up.

ORBFLIGHT Cabin
You are seated in a deep leather reclining seat, looking out a fist-sized porthole to the world outside. The ORBFLIGHT cabin is a small, leather and granite-style paneled hemisphere with a handful of similar seats, each one containing a similarly disconnected, quiet traveler. The ceiling of the cabin is a stylized celestial map.
The cabin exits to the outside, east.

The ORBGROUP flight attendant walks the cabin, making sure things are in order.

A complicated force harness keeps you buckled into your seat.

A PAXET display hinges out from your seat, waiting for a command.

The latest Zink magazine is here.

You hear the overhead intercom go on. A curt, edged voice comes on the line.
&quot;Welcome to ORBGROUP flight TWO-ALPHA-TWO, service from Johannesburg, South Africa to Alexandria, Virginia in the United States. We&apos;re uh - just coming off a bit of trouble in the terminal, but that&apos;s not our concern at the moment. ORBGROUP has told us that our safest option right now is to hook up and get skyborne. Your ORBGROUP in-can flight officers Trieste and Mercer here, letting you know today&apos;s orbital operators are on loan from Conica, who reminds you that space is a journey, not a destination.&quot;
You can hear quiet conversation in the cockpit. Finally the intercom comes back on.
&quot;We&apos;re expecting to hook up in about ten minutes, at which point we&apos;re looking at a five-minute trip up, a fifteen-minute float, and ten minutes burn to land at Alexandria, putting you on the ground at just around two-thirty AM, Eastern time.&quot;
&quot;Conica is indicating we&apos;re eight minutes from first hookup burn, so please stay in those harnesses and we&apos;ll get you weightless just as soon as we can. Thanks for coming along with us here at ORBGROUP.&quot;

A red light goes on above your head. At the same time, there is a whirring, flanging hum coming from beneath your seat.
You see the PAXET display retract into your seat as if it was taking cover.
The intercom clips on:&quot;Flight attendants verify clips closed, ground locks disengage. Dry-fuel fuse is lit.&quot;
It&apos;s only then that you realize what an ORBFLIGHT really is, outside of standard travel for the rich and powerful: it&apos;s sitting just inches above a mountain of self-oxidizing micro-solar hydrogen fuel.
&quot;Alexandria in a half-hour, folks. Here we go.&quot;
The fuel ignites.

ORBFLIGHT Cabin
Your head is crushed into your seat, unable to move - the rest of your body fares no better - you are accelerating faster, harder, than anything you have ever felt before, riding on a single solid chemical booster engine into the upper atmosphere. Your head, fixed in place as it is, fortunately has the porthole to look out at.

The ORBGROUP flight attendant sits calmly in a jumpseat, reading a magazine.

A complicated force harness keeps you buckled into your seat.

The Zink magazine is here, smeared flat against your chest.

As you are becoming familiar - almost comfortable - with the forces mashing your head into your seat, you can hear the click of the intercom.
&quot;Crew stand by for hookup and stage two acceleration.&quot;
Oh, for God&apos;s sake - 
The celestial map above you changes to a rapidly-draining timer and superimposed icon of a capsule - supposedly the aircraft you are riding in - suspended by a hook that hangs on a phantom line.
You can see nothing unusual outside, but know that the skyhook is approaching, tethered to a platform in near-earth orbit.
&quot;Folks, headwinds have put us at a bit of a velocity disadvantage - we&apos;re looking at a bit of a bumpy hookup. If you&apos;d do us a favor and keep your mouths open for just the next few seconds, you&apos;ll avoid any damage to your teeth on impact.&quot;
&quot;Five - four -&quot;
You open your mouth.
There is only the very slightest sound of steel whistling through sky, when an impact flattens you against your seat, the steel buckle of your harness stamping its mechanical imprint on your chest. Your jaw slams shut and your teeth crack against one another.
&quot;Woah,&quot; goes the intercom. The celestial map announces &quot;HOOKUP&quot;.

ORBFLIGHT Cabin
You can&apos;t breathe - you feel two-dimensional. The ORBFLIGHT you are sitting in is being flung into space by a huge slingsteel tether and orbit hook dangling from a low-earth satellite system. You try to remind yourself at some point this will all get better and your lungs will be able to inflate again. The porthole shows a rapidly-changing view. The celestial map above you has changed, too.

The ORBGROUP flight attendant appears to be asleep.

A complicated force harness keeps you buckled into your seat.

The Zink magazine has crawled up your chest and is apparently trying to choke you.

You feel the tension on your chest and neck melt away.
The sound of the rocket booster has faded as well - you are aware only of an incidental ringing left in your ears.
Breath returns to your lungs, blood once again flows to your brain. In fact, the whole of you seems to be light, rising, and free.
But it doesn&apos;t stop - you are rising from your seat, bound only by the harness. The magazine perched on your neck begins to float away, the pages flapping a little like wings.
&quot;On behalf of the first officer, myself, and all our orbital flight crew,&quot; says the intercom, &quot;Welcome to near-earth orbit and microgravity.&quot;

Terrific.

With a faint beep, your harness buckle goes from red to green.
The PAXET display that had gone underground during the pain and suffering of boost and hookup slowly extends from its hiding place, as if it were truly unaware anything had occurred.
&quot;Folks, you&apos;re free to move about the cabin for a bit as we make the suborbital leg of our journey - the cabin attendants will be sure to get you seated and buckled in when we need to prepare for retro-fire. Enjoy, and thanks for traveling with ORBGROUP.&quot;

People surround you; hurried, frayed, fast. Glass and steel beamwork cross in sweeping orbits around a large curved window that looks out over a greenbelted cityscape. The smell of hastily-fried foods mixed with heavy coffees. Black leather chairs embossed with friendly ORBGROUP logos line the main thoroughfare; white tile floors cut by vanishing-point aluminum slices extend on to the west and east until they curve out of sight. To your south is Gate Six.

There is a suited man here, busy on his phone.

People surround you; hurried, frayed, fast. Glass and steel beamwork cross in sweeping orbits around a large curved window that looks out over a greenbelted cityscape. The smell of hastily-fried foods mixed with heavy coffees. Black leather chairs embossed with friendly ORBGROUP logos line the main thoroughfare; white tile floors cut by vanishing-point aluminum slices extend on to the west and east until they curve out of sight. To your south is Gate Six.

There is a suited man here, busy on his phone.

You see your reflection in the mirror.

I&apos;m Joseph Weaver, Financial Crimes Division.&quot; Weaver looks you in the eyes, but you find it hard not to stare at the little black pistol he points right at you.

Before he can say any more, an alarm sounds throughout the concourse.

&quot;What the hell -&quot; Weaver starts, but is interrupted by gunshots down the concourse to the east - followed closely behind by screams as travelers in the departure lounge panic at the shots.

You break from him and run south to the departure lounge!

You can see Weaver catching up with you! You had better get out of here.

Departure Lounge West
The recent gunfire has transformed the departure lounge into a river of panic - travelers are diving for cover, rapidly yelling to emergency services on mobile phones, or trying to find ways out of the terminal without exposing themselves to further harm. The scene is chaos - every traveler is out for themselves.You can see the rest of the departure lounge concourse to the east, and Gate Five is to the south.

&quot;Trying to survive,&quot; the man says. &quot;Now it&apos;s your turn. Grab that man in the suit in the corner and let&apos;s go. Catch.&quot; He tosses something in the air - it slides on the tile toward you, stopping at your feet. It is a nickel-plated handgun.
&quot;My name is Clayton, by the way. Let&apos;s go.&quot;

Departure Lounge
The frenetic pace, the hurried slew of bodies, the order and linearity have all devolved at the sound of gunfire: the main departure lounge is now a huddle of frightened bodies, spilled coffee, and abandoned luggage. The concourse proceeds west and east, and Gate Six is to your south.

Clayton is here, holding the ORBGROUP agent hostage.

You see a handgun on the ground.

The suited man huddles for cover nearby.

A crash from the east concourse knocks you to the floor - smoke belches in from the east, and flickering flashlights are cutting bright planes in the oncoming cloud. You count five of them, and they are advancing fast.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Clayton says. &quot;I was afraid of that. Treasury sent a SWAT team.&quot; You can see him tighten the grip on his hostage. &quot;You get your hostage and you get ready to move! We do this together or we&apos;re both dead.&quot;

Gate 6
Gate Six is absolutely empty of life. No agent, no travelers - nothing. The panic has driven travelers to the far east and far west gates, leaving this middle gate barren.Gate Five is to the west, Gate Seven to the east, and the departure lounge is to the north. The jetdoor blocks access to a jet bridge to the south.

You can see a jetdoor and a pass reader (empty) here.

Jetbridge
You can see a jetdoor and a pressurization panel (closed) here.

There is a rapid, ripping sound of gunfire from the east concourse, followed by ominous quiet. Calls for a medic and shouts of cleared sectors eventually fill in the silence. The SWAT team must have taken Clayton down.
 You know that they&apos;re coming for you next.

The jetbridge now feels like a portal to another world, the solid slab of the jetdoor an absolute barrier between the near-death of the concourse and your own fragile body. Sounds from the concourse are muffled, far-off, and unable to get to you.

A low rumbling from somewhere outside draws your attention to the south windows of the departure lounge. You watch through the glass, and through and a haze of precautionary fire retardant glowing red from emergency lighting.

 A large mesh hoop is being drawn up to a forty-five degree angle out on the tarmac.

 The rumble grows, expands, splitting the air, layer after layer of fracturing, crackling screams. You see some of the travelers opening their mouths, stuffing their earphones deeper in their ears.

 The windows flex, pulse, vibrate. The sound grows unbearably loud - in an instant, there is a final whipcrack and the hoop is flexed to bursting, cradling a steaming, charred dart the size of a school bus.

 A voice comes over the lounge intercom: &quot;Whitmore Executive announces the arrival of flight 2A2, with service to Alexandria, Virginia, United States. This flight is now boarding at Gate Six.

You hear the overhead intercom go on. A curt, edged voice comes on the line.
&quot;Welcome to ORBGROUP flight TWO-ALPHA-TWO, service from Johannesburg, South Africa to Alexandria, Virginia in the United States. We&apos;re uh - just coming off a bit of trouble in the terminal, but that&apos;s not our concern at the moment. ORBGROUP has told us that our safest option right now is to hook up and get skyborne. Your ORBGROUP in-can flight officers Trieste and Mercer here, letting you know today&apos;s orbital operators are on loan from Conica, who reminds you that space is a journey, not a destination.&quot;
You can hear quiet conversation in the cockpit. Finally the intercom comes back on.
&quot;We&apos;re expecting to hook up in about ten minutes, at which point we&apos;re looking at a five-minute trip up, a fifteen-minute float, and ten minutes burn to land at Alexandria, putting you on the ground at just around two-thirty AM, Eastern time.&quot;
&quot;Conica is indicating we&apos;re eight minutes from first hookup burn, so please stay in those harnesses and we&apos;ll get you weightless just as soon as we can. Thanks for coming along with us here at ORBGROUP.&quot;

You break from him and run south to the departure lounge!

Departure Lounge West
The recent gunfire has transformed the departure lounge into a river of panic - travelers are diving for cover, rapidly yelling to emergency services on mobile phones, or trying to find ways out of the terminal without exposing themselves to further harm.

Weaver finds you! He points his gun at you! &quot;Drop to your knees! Get your hands behind your head!&quot;
Clayton turns his head to look at the man. &quot;Weaver,&quot; he hisses. He turns toward you. &quot;Fuck that guy! He hasn&apos;t got the guts to do anything.&quot;

*** BANG ***

You see the man collapse in a pool of blood on the ground.
Clayton looks at you, horrified. At last, he appears able to speak. &quot;That - is fucking - wonderful. You&apos;re on your own, you fuck-up.&quot;

Weaver steadies his gun on you. &quot;You&apos;re not getting out of here like this.&quot;

Clayton takes his hostage east.

*** BANG ***
The bullet tears a chunk out of the tile near his head, missing him.

Weaver steadies his gun on you. &quot;You&apos;re not getting out of here like this.&quot;

You hear the hammer of Weaver&apos;s gun click back. &quot;Suspect! Do not try to escape! Get down on your knees and put your hands behind your head! Comply!&quot;

    <result xml:space="preserve">You follow Clayton to the east departure lounge.
You are confronted by a SWAT team staring you down from the east corner of the building where they have breached a ragged hole through the sculpture.

Departure Lounge East
The east lounge is a haze of chalky white smoke that chokes out your breathing and burns your eyes. At the end of the concourse you can barely see the droplet sculpture, split in half around a ragged, burnt hole drilled violently through the acrylic. Travelers here are lying flat on their stomachs, hands over their ears, waiting for the shots to stop. The rest of the lounge is back to your west. To your south is Gate Seven. A security monitor station is to the north.

Clayton is here, holding the ORBGROUP agent hostage.

A SWAT team has their guns sighted right on you!

A departure board hangs from the ceiling. 

&quot;Target has no collateral&quot;, the SWAT team leader yells. You realize you have no hostage - nothing to protect you - and a gun in your hand! &quot;Take him down!&quot;

There is a rapid, ripping sound of gunfire from the east concourse, followed by ominous quiet. Calls for a medic and shouts of cleared sectors eventually fill in the silence. The SWAT team must have taken Clayton down.
 You know that they&apos;re coming for you next.

You hear a series of loud bangs as the SWAT team fires on you. The wind rushes out of your lungs as you crumple to the ground.



    *** You have been shot to death. ***
